#  KNIME Workflow Collection

This repository contains a set of KNIME Analytics Platform workflows for different real-world data science use cases.


## 📁 Workflow List

### 1. 🔤 Chat_Completion.knwf
**Description**:  
Implements a text generation pipeline similar to chat-based completions using NLP nodes and possibly integrated with LLM APIs.  
**Use Case**: Language generation, chatbots, or prompt engineering experimentation.  
**Highlights**:
- Tokenization and text vectorization  
- Optional integration with GPT APIs  
- Sentiment or intent tagging

### 2. 🌾 Crop Recommendation.knwf
**Description**:  
A machine learning-based system to recommend the most suitable crop based on soil and weather parameters.  
**Use Case**: Agricultural decision support for farmers.  
**Highlights**:
- Input: Nitrogen, Phosphorous, Potassium, temperature, humidity, pH, rainfall  
- Output: Recommended crop  
- Models used: Decision Tree, Random Forest  
- Evaluation: Confusion matrix, accuracy, precision

### 3. 🧬 Melanoma Cancer Detection using CNN.knwf
**Description**:  
Classifies dermoscopic skin lesion images into malignant or benign using a Convolutional Neural Network.  
**Use Case**: Early skin cancer detection from image data.  
**Highlights**:
- Image preprocessing and augmentation  
- CNN architecture built with KNIME + TensorFlow integration  
- Training and validation pipeline  
- Accuracy and loss visualization


## 🛠 Requirements
- KNIME Analytics Platform (version 4.7 or above recommended)  
- Python Integration (for CNN)  
- TensorFlow installed (for Melanoma workflow)  
- Internet (if external APIs are used in Chat Completion)


##  How to Use
1. Clone this repository or download the workflows.
2. Open KNIME.
3. Import the `.knwf` files via `File > Import KNIME Workflow`.
4. Configure necessary paths and Python/TensorFlow environment if needed.
5. Execute the workflows node by node or run them entirely.
